Humanizer
=========

Simple MIDI Humanizer LV2 Plugin.

About
-----

This plugin doesn't really do anything sofisticated. All it does is adding a random value between -20 and 20 to the MIDI signal's velocity at with a probability of 50%.

These values are currently hard coded and will hopefully be changable via a GUI from the LV2 Plugin Host in the future.

The plugin was coded within [SUSE Hackweek 18](https://hackweek.suse.com/) based on the example code from the [LV2 Book](http://lv2plug.in/book/).
